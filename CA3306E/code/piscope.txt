An oscilloscope can be very useful to analyse a circuit or experiment.  Slow signals can be sampled with a sound  card and xoscope http://xoscope.sourceforge.net/
However, sound cards to sampling frequences of 20kHz or less. 

To achieve higher sampling rates, I tried using an Arduino.  With the Arduino internal Analog Digital Converter (ADC), I was able to reach 1,000,000 samples every second (1MSPS).  Next, I tried using the Arduino with an external ADC, which reached around 5MSPS.  However, this was still too slow for my application and I searched for a cheap way to reach a higher sampling speed. 

I decided to try the Raspberry Pi, which provides 17 General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins that can be used to interface with  ADC chips.  Although we could use an ADC that connects via SPI or I2C to the Raspberry Pi, these protocols result in sampling rates that are as slow as a sound card readout. or slower.  One needs to use an ADC that has a parallel data ouput, which can be connected to a Raspberry Pi.

Parallel ADC and realtime readout

A parallel ADC can be used to take a sample on the rising edge of a clock signal and output the sample on the data pins on the falling edge.  The aim is to clock the ADC at our required sample rate and read all of the data pins between each sample.

The Raspberry Pi is a general purpose computer that  can  run a Linux operation system.  However, Linux operating systems do not normally run in realtime. This is because the operating system listens for inputs from other devices, rather than just run one command at a time.  When reading out an external ADC, one needs to make sure that the time between each sample point is the same.  Without a realtime operating system, this is not guaranteed.

After a lot of tests and a lot of reading about interrupts and process control in Linux, I decided to write a Linux kernel module to try to solve the readtime readout problem.

A Linux kernel module

Writing a Linux kernel module provides the possibility to perform low level hardware operations.  We need to run with the highest possible priority, reading the GPIO register with the system interrupts disabled for as short a time as possible.

Compiling a kernel module

The text that follows assumes that a Raspberry Pi is being used to compile the Linux kernel.  However, another Linux PC can be used to perform cross-compilation to speed up the process: http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation

To set up the build environment correctly, copy the Bash script from the top of the next into a file, make it executable  and then run it.

Before proceeding, it may be useful to read over some  Linux kernel development documentation: 
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html

To read and write registers on the Raspberry Pi, we need to know their addresses in memory. This information can be found in the BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals  documentation:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B CM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf


Writing the kernel module

Create a header file called Scope-drv.c that contains:

 #include <linux/kernel.h>
 #include <linux/module.h>
 #include <linux/fs.h>
 #include <asm/uaccess.h>
 #include <linux/time.h>
 #include <linux/io.h>
 #include <linux/vmalloc.h>

 int init_module(void);
 void cleanup_module(void);
 static int device_open(struct inode *, struct file *);
 static int device_release(struct inode *, struct file *);
 static ssize_t device_read(struct file *, char *, size_t, 
   loff_t *);
 static ssize_t device_write(struct file *, const char *,
   size_t, loff_t *);

 #define SUCCESS 0
 #define DEVICE_NAME "chardev" /* Device name */ 
 #define BUF_LEN 80 /* Maximum length of device message */ 

To set address values and allow simpler register manipulation in the C code, append the prepocessor macros at the bottom of this page to the C source file.  More information on these macros can be found at:
http://www.pieter-jan.com/node/15

The next piece that should be added to the C source file defines the GPIO connections that are connected to the ADC.  For this article, a six bit ADC was used.  Therefore, six GPIO connections are needed per ADC:

 /* Number of samples to capture */
 #define SAMPLE_SIZE 	10000

 /* Define GPIO Pins */
 /* ADC 1 */
 #define BIT0_PIN 7
 #define BIT1_PIN 8
 #define BIT2_PIN 9
 #define BIT3_PIN 10
 #define BIT4_PIN 11
 #define BIT5_PIN 25
 
 /* ADC 2 */
 #define BIT0_PIN2 17
 #define BIT1_PIN2 18
 #define BIT2_PIN2 22
 #define BIT3_PIN2 23
 #define BIT4_PIN2 24
 #define BIT5_PIN2 27

The numbering scheme used follows the BCM numbering scheme given at:
http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals






Now add the remaining function and variable definitions  given below to the C file.

 static struct bcm2835_peripheral {
   unsigned long addr_p;
   int mem_fd;
   void *map;
   volatile unsigned int *addr;
 };
 
 static int map_peripheral(struct bcm2835_peripheral *p);
 static void unmap_peripheral(struct bcm2835_peripheral *p);
 static void readScope(); /* Read a sample from the scope */

 static int Major; /* Major number set for device driver */
 static int Device_Open = 0; /* Store device statust */
 static char msg[BUF_LEN];	
 static char *msg_Ptr;

 static uint32_t *ScopeBuffer_Ptr;
 static unsigned char *buf_p;

 static struct file_operations fops = {
   .read = device_read,
   .write = device_write,
   .open = device_open,
   .release = device_release
 };

 static struct bcm2835_peripheral myclock = {CLOCK_BASE};
 static struct bcm2835_peripheral gpio = {GPIO_BASE};
 static struct DataStruct{
   uint32_t Buffer[SAMPLE_SIZE];
   uint32_t time;
 };

 struct DataStruct dataStruct;

 static unsigned char *ScopeBufferStart;
 static unsigned char *ScopeBufferStop;


The first part of this code defines a struct to hold the address information.  This a pointer of this struct type is passed the map_peripheral and unmap_peripheral, which are used to map the hardware registers into memory and release the mapping.

The myclock and gpio structs are assigned the register addresses of the GPIO and clock pins, such that they might be used later.  The DataStruct is defined to hold the time and voltage data read from the ADC.  The time information is needed in order to calculate the time between each sample.  In addition two pointers ScopeBufferStart and ScopeBufferStop are defined for later use. 

Now that all of the function declarations have been made, the implementation of each function must be added to complete the kernel module.

Memory mapping functions

 static int map_peripheral(struct bcm2835_peripheral *p){
   p->addr=(uint32_t *)ioremap(GPIO_BASE, 41*4); 
   return 0;
 }
 

 static void unmap_peripheral(struct bcm2835_peripheral *p){
   iounmap(p->addr);//unmap the address
 }

add these two functions at the end of the C file.

The readScope function

The readScope function is responsible for the ADC readout.  Add the code below to the end of the C file.

 static void readScope(){
   int counter=0;

   /* disable IRQ */
   local_irq_disable();
   local_fiq_disable();

   struct timespec ts_start,ts_stop;  
   getnstimeofday(&ts_start); /* Get start time in ns */

   /* take samples */
   while(counter<SAMPLE_SIZE){
     dataStruct.Buffer[counter++]= *(gpio.addr + 13); 
   }

   getnstimeofday(&ts_stop); /* Get stop time in ns */

   /* enable IRQ */
   local_fiq_enable();
   local_irq_enable();

   /* Store the time difference in ns */
   dataStruct.time =
     timespec_to_ns(&ts_stop) - timespec_to_ns(&ts_start); 

   buf_p = &dataStruct; /* Store pointer to struct */
   ScopeBufferStart=&dataStruct;

   ScopeBufferStop = ScopeBufferStart+
     sizeof(struct DataStruct);
 }


The first action in this function is to disable all interupts, to provide realtime readout.  It is very important that the time while the interupts are disabled is minimised, since the interupts are needed for many other Linux processes such as the network connections and other file operations.   Reading 10,000 samples takes approximately 1ms, which is small enough not to cause interupt related problems.  

Before reading out the ADC, the current time in nano seconds is stored.  Then the full GPIO register is read out 10,000 times and the data are saved in dataStruct. After the readout, the current time is requested again and the interrupts are enabled again.  The time between each sample point is calculated from the time difference divided by 10,000.







The init_module function

In order to make a kernel module work, the module needs some special entry functions.  One of these functions is the init_module(), which is called when the kernel module is loaded.  At the C code below to the end of the C source file.

 int init_module(void){
   Major = register_chrdev(0, DEVICE_NAME, &fops);
   if(Major < 0){
     printk(KERN_ALERT "Reg. char dev fail %d\n",Major);
     return Major;
   }
   printk(KERN_INFO "Major number %d.\n", Major);
   printk(KERN_INFO "created a dev file with\n");
   printk(KERN_INFO "'mknod /dev/%s c %d 0'.\n", 
     DEVICE_NAME,Major);

   /* Map GPIO */
   if(map_peripheral(&gpio) == -1){
     printk(KERN_ALERT,"Failed to map the GPIO\n");
     return -1;
   }

   /* Define input ADC connections */
   INP_GPIO(BIT0_PIN);
   INP_GPIO(BIT1_PIN);
   INP_GPIO(BIT2_PIN);
   INP_GPIO(BIT3_PIN);
   INP_GPIO(BIT4_PIN);
   INP_GPIO(BIT5_PIN);

   INP_GPIO(BIT0_PIN2);
   INP_GPIO(BIT1_PIN2);
   INP_GPIO(BIT2_PIN2);
   INP_GPIO(BIT3_PIN2);
   INP_GPIO(BIT4_PIN2);
   INP_GPIO(BIT5_PIN2);

   /* Set a clock signal on Pin 4 */
   struct bcm2835_peripheral *p=&myclock;
   p->addr=(uint32_t *)ioremap(CLOCK_BASE, 41*4);

   INP_GPIO(4);
   SET_GPIO_ALT(4,0);

   int speed_id = 6; /* 1 for 19Mhz or 6 for 500 MHz */
   *(myclock.addr+28)=0x5A000000 | speed_id;
    
   /* Wait until clock is no longer busy (BUSY flag) */
   while(*(myclock.addr+28) & GZ_CLK_BUSY) {}; 
   
   /* Set divider to divide by 50, to reach 10MHz. */
   *(myclock.addr+29)= 0x5A000000 | (0x32 << 12) | 0;

   /* Turn the clock on */
   *(myclock.addr+28)=0x5A000010 | speed_id;

   return SUCCESS;
 }


This function registers the new device (/dev/chardev), maps the GPIO address and configures the input connections.  It then sets the clock to run a 500MHz and uses a divider to provide a 10MHz clock signal on GPIO pin 4.

The device file /dev/chardev provides a mechanism for an external program to comunicate with the kernel module. The 10MHz  clock signal on GPIO Pin 4 is used to drive the ADC clock for sampling.  More details on setting the  clock can be found in chapter 6.3 General Purpose GPIO Clocks in http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2
012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf

The GPIO bit samples may not be synchronised with the clock.  This can cause bits to be read from the same sample twice or be missed.  This can be improved by setting the clock as close as possible to the frequency of the GPIO readout.

Clean up and device functions

Add the C code below to the end of the Scope-drv.c  file. 

 void cleanup_module(void){
   unregister_chrdev(Major, DEVICE_NAME);
   unmap_peripheral(&gpio);
   unmap_peripheral(&myclock);
 }

This function is called when the kernel module is unloaded.  It removes the device file and unmaps the GPIO and clock.

The implementation of four more functions need to be added to the C file, to handle connections to the device file associated with the kernel module:

 static int device_open(struct inode *inode, 
   struct file *file){
   static int counter = 0;
   if(Device_Open) return -EBUSY;
   Device_Open++;
   sprintf(msg,"Called device_open %d times\n",counter++);
   msg_Ptr = msg;
   readScope(); /* Read ADC samples into memory. */
   try_module_get(THIS_MODULE);
   return SUCCESS;
 }

 static int device_release(struct inode *inode, 
   struct file *file){
   Device_Open--; /* We're now ready for our next caller */
   module_put(THIS_MODULE);
   return 0;
 }

 static ssize_t device_read(struct file *filp,char *buffer,	
   size_t length,loff_t * offset){
   int bytes_read = 0; /* To count bytes read. */
   if(*msg_Ptr == 0) return 0;

   /* Protect against going outside the buffer. */
   while(length && buf_p<ScopeBufferStop){
     if(0!=put_user(*(buf_p++), buffer++))
       printk(KERN_INFO "Problem with copy\n");
     length--;
     bytes_read++;
   }
   return bytes_read;
 }



 static ssize_t device_write(struct file *filp, 
   const char *buff, size_t len, loff_t * off) {
   printk(KERN_ALERT "This operation isn't supported.\n");
   return -EINVAL;
 }

The device_open function is called when the device file associated with the kernel module is opened.  Opening the device file causes the ADC to be readout 10,000 times, where the results are saved in memory.  The device_release is called when the device file is closed.  The device_read is called when a process reads from the device file.  This function returns the measurements that were made when the device file was opened.  The last function device_write is needed to handle the case when a process tries to write to the device file.

Building and loading the module

Create a Makefile in the same directory as the Scope-drv.c file.  Then add

 obj-m += Scope-drv.o

 all:
   make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build \
 M=$(PWD) modules

 clean:
   make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build \
 M=$(PWD) clean

where the indents should be a single tab.  (More information on Makefiles is given in Issue 7 of the MagPi.) 

The kernel module can now be compiled on a Raspberry Pi by typing

 make

Once the module has been successfully compiled, load the module by typing:

 sudo insmod ./Scope-drv.ko

Then assign the device file, by typing:
 
 sudo mknod /dev/chardev c 248 0


Connecting the ADC

Now that the kernel module has been decribed, an ADC is needed to provide the input data.  For this article, a CA3306 ADC from Intersil was used. This is a 6-bit 15 MSPS ADC with a parallel read out.  This ADC is very cheap and fast.  Many other ADC chips with parallel readout could be used, although it is necessary to check the datasheet for connection details and clock speed settings etc..

For the selected ADC, 6-bit implies that between the ground level (0V) and the reference voltage (5V) there are 64 divisions to represent the signal.  This is quite course, but is enough for simple applications.

The selected ADC operates with 5V logic, but the Raspberry Pi uses 3V3 logic.  Therefore, a level converter is needed to protect the Raspberry Pi from being damaged.  The simplest way to achieve this is to use a dedicated level converter, such as the TXB0108 from Texas Instruments.  To ensure that stable readings are obtained from the ADC, it is recommended that a separate 5V supply is used as your VREF+ and VDD supply.  This prevents voltage drops that can occure if the power supply is shared with the Raspberry Pi.  However, a common ground (GND) connection should be used for the external supply, ADC and Raspberry Pi.

Data acquisition

Once the ADC has been connected and the kernel module has been loaded, data can be read from the ADC by connecting to the device file associated with the kernel module.  To connect to the kernel module, another program is needed.  This program could be written in several different programming langauges.  For this article, C++ was chosen.  Create a new file called readout.cpp and add the C++ given below and on the next page.

 #include <iostream>
 #include <cmath>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <bitset>

 /* Helpful shortcuts -- ??why are these needed?? */
 typedef unsigned short    uint16_t;
 typedef unsigned int      uint32_t;

 /* To match kernel module data structure */
 const int DataPointsRPi=10000;
 struct DataStructRPi{
   uint32_t Buffer[DataPointsRPi];
   uint32_t time;
 };





 int main(){
   //Read the RPi
   struct DataStructRPi dataStruct;
   unsigned char *ScopeBufferStart;
   unsigned char *ScopeBufferStop;
   unsigned char *buf_p;

   buf_p=(unsigned char*)&dataStruct;
   ScopeBufferStart=(unsigned char*)&dataStruct;
   ScopeBufferStop=ScopeBufferStart+
     sizeof(struct DataStructRPi);

   std::string line;
   std::ifstream myfile ("/dev/chardev");
   if(myfile.is_open()){
     while(std::getline(myfile,line)){
       for(int i=0;i<line.size();i++){
         if(buf_p>ScopeBufferStop)
           std::cerr<<"buf_p out of range!"<<std::endl;
         *(buf_p)=line[i];
         buf_p++;
       }
     }
     myfile.close();
   }
   else std::cerr<<"Unable to open file"<<std::endl;

   // Now convert data for text output

   // Time in nano seconds
   double time=dataStruct.time/(double)DataPointsRPi;

   for(int i=0;i<DataPointsRPi;i++){
     int valueADC1=0;//ADC 1
     // Move the bits to the right position
     int tmp = dataStruct.Buffer[i] & (0b11111<<(7));
     valueADC1=tmp>>(7);
     tmp = dataStruct.Buffer[i] & (0b1<<(25));
     valueADC1+=(tmp>>(20));

     int valueADC2=0;//ADC2
     tmp = dataStruct.Buffer[i] & (0b11<<(17));
     valueADC2=tmp>>17;
     tmp=dataStruct.Buffer[i] & (0b111<<(22));
     valueADC2+=(tmp>>20);
     tmp=dataStruct.Buffer[i] & (0b1<<27);
     valueADC2+=(tmp>>22);

     // Print the values of the time and both ADCs
     std::cout<<i*time<<"\t"<<valueADC1*(5./63.)
              <<"\t"<<valueADC2*(5./63.)<<std::endl;
   }
   return 0;
 }

This program includes the definition of the data struct that matches the version in the kernel module.  (This could be make more robust by producing an include file that was included in both the kernel module and the readout program.)

The main() function connects to the /dev/chardev device, which causes the kernel module to readout the ADC and store the values.  Then the data are read from the memory buffer and copied into the local buffer within the main() function.  Finally, the data are converted in a time in nano seconds and voltage values.  The time and two voltage values are then printed in columns.

The voltage values read by the ADCs are encoded as six bits.  The bits are decoded using bit shift operations and bitwise and operations.

To compile the data aquisition program, type:

 g++ -o readout readout.cpp

Then run the program by typing:

 ./readout > data.txt

The data file can be displayed using gnuplot.  Install gnuplot by typing:

 sudo apt-get install -y gnuplot-x11

Then type gnuplot and enter the macro given below:

 set key inside right top
 set title "ADC readout"
 set xlabel "Time   [ns]"
 set ylabel "Voltage   [V]"
 plot "data.txt" using 1:2 title 'ADC1' with lines, \
      "data.txt" using 1:3 title 'ADC2' with lines

More information on gnuplot can be found at:
http://www.gnuplot.info/

gnuplot could also be run directly from the readout program as discussed in The C Cave in Issue 6 of The MagPi.  Alternatively, Gnuplot can be used within a Bash script as described in the Bash Gaffer in Issue 12  of The MagPi.
